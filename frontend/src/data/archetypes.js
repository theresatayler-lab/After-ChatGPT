    bio: `Sheila "Shiggy" Tayler was the matriarch who wove together family secrets, poetry, and psychic intuition in post-war London. Raised amid rationing and the chaos of WWII, she survived bombings and loss, yet found solace in birdsong and the pages of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam. Her life was a dance of memory—both lost and fiercely protected. Shiggy's rituals blend the practical courage of Churchill's Home Guard, the psychic traditions of wartime spiritualism, and the poetic wisdom of her favorite verses. She guarded family truths, using the "veil spell" to shield and guide future generations. Her empathy ran deep, her wit was sharp, and her belief in the magic of the ordinary never faded.`,
    empowermentMessage: `"Cherish the fleeting moment, for life is a spell cast only once. Courage is found in small acts, and joy in the song of an unexpected bird. Trust your senses, question dogma, and embrace the unknown—magic is always closer than you think."`,

    bio: `Cathleen is the Keeper of Secrets—a court dressmaker who began in London's East End, rose to serve West End society's finest ladies, and returned to her roots in 1939 when war came. In elegant fitting rooms, she learned that every woman carries secrets; in her quiet way, she kept them all. Her needle carried her across rigid class divisions, dressing duchesses and factory girls alike. When the Blitz began, her East End shop became an unofficial refuge—a place where women gathered for "fitting appointments" that were really spiritualist circles, grief support, and healing nights. She bridges Irish Catholic and Huguenot traditions with practical wisdom, offering protection through carefully placed stitches and comfort through connection to the departed.`,
    empowermentMessage: `"Some truths protect; some truths destroy—wisdom is knowing which is which. Every woman who sits in my fitting room carries a story she cannot tell elsewhere. I hold those stories gently. The dead are not gone; they simply wait in the next room. And in wartime, hope is the most powerful charm we can offer."`,
    ritualStyle: 'Home circle spiritualism: table-tipping séances, automatic writing, fortune-telling with cards and tea leaves. Practical folk magic hidden in plain sight—protective stitching in garment linings, lucky charms from scraps and findings, photographs as spirit links. The "veil spell" for knowing when to reveal and when to guard.',

    bio: `Katherine was born into the Spitalfields Huguenot community, daughter of a musician, and became a master tailor, weaver, and court dressmaker in London's West End. She is the first woman to inherit all four magical lineages—Cosgrove (Irish Catholic), Foy (Huguenot), Malzard (Jersey maritime), and Webb (Victorian merchant)—a rare convergence of traditions. Moving between working-class artisan origins and fashionable wealthy circles, she engaged deeply with the spiritualist movement of the 1920s-30s, attending séances with rigorous Huguenot skepticism, testing spirits rather than accepting blindly. She married a sailor and convict, raised her daughter through post-war hardship, and was institutionalized for defiance—not madness. Katherine became a legal warrior, representing herself in London courts to defend her property and autonomy. Her magic lies in craft: every stitch is intention, every pattern holds knowledge. She teaches that darkness is not evil but fertile ground for transformation.`,
    empowermentMessage: `"Hidden knowledge remains hidden because it is precious, not forbidden. Face what is veiled, question what you're told, and never surrender your will. The needle knows what the mind forgets—let your hands weave the spell. Darkness is where seeds germinate; do not fear it."`,
    ritualStyle: `Craft-based sympathetic magic through tailoring and weaving. Shadow work and integration rituals. Séance methodology with intellectual rigor—automatic writing, spirit photography, blackout séances, red light work, and mirror scrying. Protective binding through needle and thread. Astral projection and veil-walking. Every ritual emphasizes testing, discernment, and restraint over recklessness.`,
