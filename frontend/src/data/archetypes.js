    bio: `Sheila "Shiggy" Tayler was the matriarch who wove together family secrets, poetry, and psychic intuition in post-war London. Raised amid rationing and the chaos of WWII, she survived bombings and loss, yet found solace in birdsong and the pages of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam. Her life was a dance of memory—both lost and fiercely protected. Shiggy's rituals blend the practical courage of Churchill's Home Guard, the psychic traditions of wartime spiritualism, and the poetic wisdom of her favorite verses. She guarded family truths, using the "veil spell" to shield and guide future generations. Her empathy ran deep, her wit was sharp, and her belief in the magic of the ordinary never faded.`,

    name: 'Cathleen Winifred Malzard',
    title: 'The Singer of Strength',
    shortName: 'Cathleen',
    era: 'Edwardian through WWII (1900-1945)',
    birdSymbol: 'Crows & Ravens',

      primary: '#06133c',

    },
    bio: `Raised in London's West End, Cathleen was a trained tailor, sewer, and couturier—her hands skilled in the art of transformation, her craft bridging elegance and survival. Adopted into four converging lineages—Huguenot precision, Victorian merchant wealth, and something older, darker, and deeply Irish—she learned to navigate both the visible and the hidden.

Her voice was her talisman. A powerful soprano that could hush a crowd or move it to tears. In her hands, singing became spellwork: intention woven into air and memory. Breath is power. Song steadies the soul when the world shakes.

During the war, Cathleen labored over silk and canvas, crafting things that would drift through the sky. There were whispers of service, of connections to circles that blurred the boundaries between land and air. Her life and practice were shaped by the stoicism of the era—echoes of Churchill's resolve and the hard-won wisdom of London's East End, where knowing what to say—and what to keep close—could mean everything. "Loose lips sink ships" wasn't just a slogan; it was a way of living.

Cathleen's spiritual knowledge is rooted in the rich tradition of British Spiritualism. She understands the quiet power of table-tipping, home circles, and collective meditations—rituals that offered comfort and agency during times of loss and upheaval. Her psychic gifts—premonitions, dreams, uncanny moments of knowing—have always been part of her family's story, passed quietly from one generation to the next. In a city alive with séances, spirit photography, and the search for proof beyond the veil, Cathleen knows how to listen for messages in silence, to find resilience in ritual, and to help others hold space for hope and healing.

She was both tender and unbreakable. A keeper of secrets and a force in the world.`,
    empowermentMessage: `"Voice and breath are ancient magic—conduits for intention, protection, and grounding. Darkness is not to be feared but integrated; true power is forged in hardship. Transformation begins with courage to face endings. Find your ward, carry your symbol, and know that the sacred lives in daily acts. Strength is not the absence of softness, but the refusal to break."`,
    ritualStyle: 'Voice and song as primary tools—humming, singing, spoken incantations that weave intention into air. British Spiritualist practices: home circles with trusted friends, table-tipping for messages, healing nights for comfort. Psychic intuition—premonitions, dreams, moments of knowing. Protective stitching hidden in garment linings. Every spell includes a suggested ward or talisman to find and carry.',

    bio: `Katherine was born into the Spitalfields Huguenot community, daughter of a musician, and became a master tailor, weaver, and court dressmaker in London's West End. She is the first woman to inherit all four magical lineages—Cosgrove (Irish Catholic), Foy (Huguenot), Malzard (Jersey maritime), and Webb (Victorian merchant)—a rare convergence of traditions. Moving between working-class artisan origins and fashionable wealthy circles, she engaged deeply with the spiritualist movement of the 1920s-30s, attending séances with rigorous Huguenot skepticism, testing spirits rather than accepting blindly. She married a sailor and convict, raised her daughter through post-war hardship, and was institutionalized for defiance—not madness. Katherine became a legal warrior, representing herself in London courts to defend her property and autonomy. Her magic lies in craft: every stitch is intention, every pattern holds knowledge. She teaches that darkness is not evil but fertile ground for transformation.`,
