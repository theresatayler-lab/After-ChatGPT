# 🎭 OVERVIEW: THE THREE PERSONAS

Each archetype represents a distinct approach to magic, rooted in documented historical practices, real spiritual movements, and authentic British folk traditions. The goal is for users to feel that:

1. **Each spell feels personally crafted** - not generic
2. **Each archetype has a unique voice and method** - unmistakably different
3. **Every ritual is traceable to real history** - not made up
4. **The magic feels earned, not given** - rooted in lived wisdom
